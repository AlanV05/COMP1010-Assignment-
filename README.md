COMP1010 Assignment (Football League) 

### Feedback from Checkpoint 1:
"Overall, design and scope are good covering all the required aspects. The classes might be doing a lot here. points and goals could be separated from the Team class and Player class into a new class 'standings' or 'stats'. Similarly, match can be separated from the class League."

What we need to do.
  For the code:
      1. Unit testing for 10 non-trivial functions
      
      2. Have one instance of recursive data structure
      
      3. Delegation -> What to change regarding classes: 
      // Create a new class could "Statistics" or "Stats" where the goal difference, points, goals for and againts, are recorded. 
      // This makes the classes have a cleaner and more readable sensable structure.
      // Similarly with league Class move stats related methods to the Stats class, again making it organised.
