COMP1010 Assignment (Football League) 

### Feedback from Checkpoint 1:
"Overall, design and scope are good covering all the required aspects. The classes might be doing a lot here. points and goals could be separated from the Team class and Player class into a new class 'standings' or 'stats'. Similarly, match can be separated from the class League."

What we need to do.
  For the code:
      1. Unit testing for 10 non-trivial functions
      2. Have one instance of recursive data structure

  Documentation:
      1. Design process 
      2. Task allocation
