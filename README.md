COMP1010 Assignment (Football League) 

### Feedback from Checkpoint 1:
"Overall, design and scope are good covering all the required aspects. The classes might be doing a lot here. points and goals could be separated from the Team class and Player class into a new class 'standings' or 'stats'. Similarly, match can be separated from the class League."
