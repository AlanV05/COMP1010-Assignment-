# COMP1010-Assignment-
COMP1010 Assignment (Football League) 

04/09/24:
-   	We all met as a group and discussed what we wanted to do before next week (basically set an agenda). The purpose of the meeting was to finalise what we were going to make and set out a generic plan for how to do it so we could get started. The tasks due by next week were: Start UML diagram -> Alan and Heinrich and start coding/documentation -> Ashley and Arpit.

11/09/24:
-   	We were going to all meet in person and do a bit more work on the project, but Alan had some work commitments so we decided that we’d chill for today and just look over the code we had so far. The good thing is that we have started early and can afford to take our time. Before next week the tasks set are:
    -   	Finish last week’s tasks (if not done already)
    -     	Look over the requirements sheet Heinrich wrote
    -     	Look over the code we have so far

26/09/24:
-   	Problem statement
-   	Design Process
-   	Work on code 




### Feedback from Checkpoint 1:
"Overall, design and scope are good covering all the required aspects. The classes might be doing a lot here. points and goals could be separated from the Team class and Player class into a new class 'standings' or 'stats'. Similarly, match can be separated from the class League."



What we need to do:


For the code:
  
      1. Unit testing for 10 non-trivial functions
      
      2. Have one instance of recursive data structure

      3. More Commenting
      
      4. Delegation -> What to change regarding classes: 
      // Create a new class could "Statistics" or "Stats" where the goal difference, points, goals for and againts, are recorded. 
      // This makes the classes have a cleaner and more readable sensable structure.
      // Similarly with league Class move stats related methods to the Stats class, again making it organised.
      // To make it more simple we can automate the scores and the goal scorers. 
      // The only input the user needs to do is Teams and players.
